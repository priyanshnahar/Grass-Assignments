In JavaScript we can declare variables by using 3 keywords which are :-
Let, Var, and Const

Difference between Var, Let and Const
1. Var:- We can say var is a Global or functional scope which means we can access
var inside the function (variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function) and outside the function can be access globally
for example:- 
var a = 10
function b(){
    console.log(a);
}
b();
console.log(a);

In the above example we have declared variable a globally therefore for we can access it everywhere in the programm 
and we will get the answer :- 
10
10

But now if we describe the var inside the function then what result will we get let's see

function b(){
    var a = 10;
    console.log(a)
}
b();
console.log(a);

So in the above example we have declared variable inside the function and we are trying to acces it outside the function,
The results are:-
10
VM53:6 Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
    at <anonymous>:6:13

2. Let:- let is a block scope variable which means it can't be accessebale outiside the block 
let a = 10;
function b(){
    let b = 9
    console.log(b);
    console.log(a);
}
b();

here the ans wil be 
9
10

3. Const:- The scope of a const variable is also block scope we can not update the const variables 
for example 

const a = 10;
console.log(a);
const a = 9;
console.log(a);

in the above example we have change the value of a two times
