What is Hoisting in JavaScript?

in js hoisiting it will appear line by line which means first it willl declare all the variables at the top,
then it will declare all the functions and then it will describe all the values 

One of the advantages of hoisting is that it lets you use a function before you declare it in your code 

for example:- 
myName("Priyansh");

function myName(name) {
  console.log(`My name is ${name}`);
}
